## Introduction

Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve information stored within a data structure. The efficiency of these algorithms can significantly impact the performance of software applications, especially when dealing with large datasets. This guide will introduce you to various searching algorithms, their implementations, and use cases.

## Types of Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search

Linear search is the simplest search algorithm. It checks each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

**Properties**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Implementation**:
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```
