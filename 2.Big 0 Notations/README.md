## Introduction

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. They are critical for designing efficient algorithms and software systems. This guide will introduce various data structures, their operations, and practical applications.

## Types of Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements identified by index or key.

- **Properties**:
  - Fixed size.
  - Elements of the same type.
  - Random access by index.

- **Common Operations**:
  - Accessing elements: `array[index]`
  - Insertion and deletion (typically requires shifting elements).

```python
# Example in Python
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(array[2])  # Output: 3
```
