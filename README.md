### **What's a Data Structure?**

Organization of Data: Data structures help in organizing data in a way that it can be efficiently used and modified. The organization can be in the form of arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.

Types of Data Structures:

Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged in a sequential manner. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
Non-Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner. Examples include trees (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees) and graphs.
Operations on Data Structures:

Insertion: Adding a new element.
Deletion: Removing an existing element.
Traversal: Accessing each element exactly once in a specific order.
Searching: Finding the location of a specific element.
Sorting: Arranging elements in a certain order.
Common Data Structures:

Array: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
Linked List: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
Stack: A collection of elements with Last In First Out (LIFO) access.
Queue: A collection of elements with First In First Out (FIFO) access.
Tree: A hierarchical structure with a root node and children nodes forming a parent-child relationship.
Graph: A set of nodes connected by edges.
Applications:

Arrays and Linked Lists: Used for implementing other data structures and algorithms.
Stacks: Used in function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.
Queues: Used in scheduling processes, managing resources in networks.
Trees: Used in databases, file systems, and organizing hierarchical data.
Graphs: Used in network analysis, social network connections, and pathfinding algorithms.
