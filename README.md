### **What's a Data Structure?**

Organization of Data: Data structures help in organizing data in a way that it can be efficiently used and modified. The organization can be in the form of arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.

## Types of Data Structures:

  + Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged in a sequential manner. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
  
  + Non-Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner. Examples include trees (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees) and graphs.
  Operations on Data Structures:

  1. Insertion: Adding a new element.
  
  2. Deletion: Removing an existing element.
  
  3. Traversal: Accessing each element exactly once in a specific order.
  
  4. Searching: Finding the location of a specific element.
  
  5. Sorting: Arranging elements in a certain order.

## Common Data Structures:

  1. Array: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
  
  2. Linked List: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
  
  3. Stack: A collection of elements with Last In First Out (LIFO) access.
  
  4. Queue: A collection of elements with First In First Out (FIFO) access.
  
  5. Tree: A hierarchical structure with a root node and children nodes forming a parent-child relationship.
  
  6. Graph: A set of nodes connected by edges.
   
## Applications:

  + Arrays and Linked Lists: Used for implementing other data structures and algorithms.
  
  + Stacks: Used in function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.
  
  + Queues: Used in scheduling processes, managing resources in networks.
  
  + Trees: Used in databases, file systems, and organizing hierarchical data.
  
  + Graphs: Used in network analysis, social network connections, and pathfinding algorithms.
